# Mandrill Mailer gem
MandrilMailer class for sending transactional emails through mandril.
Only template based emails are supported at this time.

## Usage
Add `gem 'mandrill_mailer'` to your Gemfile

Add this to your `mail.rb` in initializers.
You don't need to add the ActionMailer stuff unless your still using ActionMailer emails.
This just plugs into the Mandrill smtp servers. If your doing template based emails
through the Mandrill api you really only need the `MandrillMailer.configure` part

```
ActionMailer::Base.smtp_settings = {
    :address   => "smtp.mandrillapp.com",
    :port      => 587,
    :user_name => ENV['MANDRILL_USERNAME'],
    :password  => ENV['MANDRILL_PASSWORD'],
    :domain    => 'heroku.com'
  }
ActionMailer::Base.delivery_method = :smtp

MandrillMailer.configure do |config|
  config.api_key = ENV['MANDRILL_API_KEY']
end
```

Don't forget to setup your ENV variables on your server

You will also need to set default_url_options for the mailer, similar to action mailer
in your environment config files:

`config.mandrill_mailer.default_url_options = { :host => 'localhost' }`

## Creating a new mailer
Creating a new Mandrill Mailer is similar to a normal Rails mailer:

```
 class InvitationMailer < MandrillMailer::TemplateMailer
   default from: 'support@example.com'

   def invite(invitation)
     mandrill_mail template: 'Group Invite',
       subject: I18n.t('invitation_mailer.invite.subject'),
       to: invitation.invitees.map {|invitee| { email: invitee.email, name: invitee.name }},
       # to: {email: invitation.email, name: 'Honored Guest'},
       vars: {
         'OWNER_NAME' => invitation.owner_name,
         'PROJECT_NAME' => invitation.project_name
       },
       recipient_vars: invitation.invitees.map do |invitee| # invitation.invitees is an Array                  ,
                         { invitee.email =>
                           {
                             'INVITEE_NAME' => invitee.name,
                             'INVITATION_URL' => new_invitation_url(invitee.email, secret: invitee.secret_code)
                           }
                         }
                       end
   end
 end
 ```

* `#default:`
  * `:from` - set the default from email address for the mailer
  * `:from_name` - set the default from name for the mailer. If not set, defaults to from email address. Setting :from_name in the .mandrill_mail overrides the default.

* `.mandrill_mail`
   * `:template`(required) - Template name from within Mandrill

   * `:subject`(required) - Subject of the email

   * `:to`(required) - Accepts an email String, or hash with :name and :email keys
     ex. `{email: 'someone@email.com', name: 'Bob Bertly'}`

   * `:vars` - A Hash of merge tags made available to the email. Use them in the
     email by wrapping them in `*||*` vars: {'OWNER_NAME' => 'Suzy'} is used
     by doing: `*|OWNER_NAME|*` in the email template within Mandrill

   * `:recipient_vars` - Similar to `:vars`, this is a Hash of merge tags specific to a particular recipient.
     Use this if you are sending batch transactions and hence need to send multiple emails at one go.
     ex. `[{'someone@email.com' => {'INVITEE_NAME' => 'Roger'}}, {'another@email.com' => {'INVITEE_NAME' => 'Tommy'}}]`

   * `:template_content` - A Hash of values and content for Mandrill editable content blocks.
     In MailChimp templates there are editable regions with 'mc:edit' attributes that look
     a little like: `<div mc:edit="header">My email content</div>` You can insert content directly into
     these fields by passing a Hash `{'header' => 'my email content'}`

   * `:headers` - Extra headers to add to the message (currently only Reply-To and X-* headers are allowed) {"...": "..."}

   * `:bcc` - Add an email to bcc to

   * `:tags` - Array of Strings to tag the message with. Stats are
   accumulated using tags, though we only store the first 100 we see,
   so this should not be unique or change frequently. Tags should be
   50 characters or less. Any tags starting with an underscore are
   reserved for internal use and will cause errors.

   * `:google_analytics_domains` - Array of Strings indicating for which any
   matching URLs will automatically have Google Analytics parameters appended
   to their query string automatically.

   * `:google_analytics_campaign` - String indicating the value to set for
   the utm_campaign tracking parameter. If this isn't provided the email's
   from address will be used instead.

## Sending an email

You can send the email by using the familiar syntax:

`InvitationMailer.invite(invitation).deliver`

## Creating a test method
When switching over to Mandrill for transactional emails we found that it was hard to setup a mailer in the console to send test emails easily (those darn designers), but really, you don't want to have to setup test objects everytime you want to send a test email. You can set up a testing 'mock' once and then call the `.test` method to send the test email.

You can test the above email by typing: `InvitationMailer.test(:invite, email:<your email>)` into the Rails Console.

The test for this particular Mailer is setup like so:

```
test_setup_for :invite do |mailer, options|
    invitation = MandrillMailer::Mock.new({
      email: options[:email],
      owner_name: 'foobar',
      secret: rand(9000000..1000000).to_s
    })
    mailer.invite(invitation).deliver
end
```

Use MandrillMailer::Mock to mock out objects.

If in order to represent a url within a mock, make sure there is a `url` or `path` attribute,
for example, if I had a course mock and I was using the `course_url` route helper within the mailer
I would create the mock like so:

```
course = MandrillMailer::Mock.new({
  title: 'zombies',
  type: 'Ruby',
  url: 'http://funzone.com/zombies'
})
```

This would ensure that `course_url(course)` works as expected.

The mailer and options passed to the `.test` method are yielded to the block.

The `:email` option is the only required option, make sure to add at least this to your test object.

## TODO
Either get rid of the mailchimp gem dependancy or hook into actionmailer like the mailchimp does to send normal emails.
